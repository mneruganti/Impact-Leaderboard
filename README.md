# Impact Leaderboard

The **Impact Leaderboard** is a full-stack project that reimagines rankings like Forbes by focusing on **positive societal impact**, not just wealth.  
It assigns a **Ripple Score** to influential living individuals using real-time data and three core metrics:  
- **Reach** → Wikipedia pageviews  
- **Depth** → recognition & contributions (knowledge graph / external data)  
- **Duration** → longevity of influence (Wikipedia revision history, Google Trends)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express  
- **Data Sources**: Wikipedia REST API, Wikidata API, Google Trends API  

## 🌟 Impact
By filtering out controversial or historical figures, the platform surfaces **scientists, activists, and creators driving real value** — offering a transparent, ethical alternative to wealth-only rankings.
